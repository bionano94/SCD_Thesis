I would like to express my gratitude to my primary supervisor, Prof. G. Castellani, who accepted to assist me during this project.
I am deeply grateful to my friend and co-supervisor of this work of thesis Dr. R. Biondi to have constantly helped and beared me throughout the whole development of this project and to have made possible my foolish project to graduate in this session.
The assistance provided by Dr. S. Polizzi with my last exam was greatly appreciated.

I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to my family, who constantly supported me and my decisions throughout all my life, giving me the opportunity to reach this goal with the time and the path I needed.
I would like to offer my special thanks to Giorgiah, who permitted me to focus only on the achievement on this goal, standing by my side and constantly supporting me in so many ways that this page can not contain.
Finally I would like to thank all my friends that have followed my path during this almost ten years and and always helped me overcome the difficulties I encountered and being ready to celebrate this goal.
